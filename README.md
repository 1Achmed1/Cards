# Cards
A CSS website design for Google's Material Design.

## Download
I draft releases for every version of cards, but not for every commit. Prereleases are tagged as prereleases, and despite the rapid development nature of prereleases, releases are infrequent still. You can head over to the releases section and download the latest version of Cards:

[Releases (Github)](https://github.com/1Achmed1/Cards/releases)

Future releases will include a zip containing Cards without the code examples and demos.

## Installation
I've put an effort in to this project, making it so that there is no compiling required to make this work. The LESS compiler is included, making CSS edits easy, and as long as your server supports HTML, Javascript, and CSS, Cards should work. Given its open source and hackable nature, I'm *not* offering support for Cards.

To install Cards, download it, make edits and whatnot, and upload it to your server. No database migration is needed.
